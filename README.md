# Fenders Website

-   The Fenders Perth Meetup website.

## TODO

Check issues for current items or create an issue if you have anything in mind.

## Meetup events

Events are pulled from the Meetup API using this endpoint:
https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/:urlname/events/#list

`:urlname`: Front-End-Web-Developers-Perth

## Running in development

`yarn start`

## Git Workflow

Get in touch with one of the organisers to get access to the repository :smiley:

1. To make changes, create a new branch off `master` as a `feature-branch` to perform the work
2. Submit a PR to merge your `feature-branch` into `master`, and get someone from `fendersperth/fenders-website` to approve it (add them to the review and they'll get a notification)
3. Once someone has approved the request, merge it into `master` :+1:
