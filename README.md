# Fenders Website
- The Fenders Perth Meetup website.

## TODO
- [x] Setup components
- [ ] Convert CSS to Emotion or Styled Components
- [ ] Pull Meetup events in from Meetup.com

## Running in development
`gatsby develop`


## Git Workflow
Get in touch with one of the organisers to get access to the repository :smiley:
1. To make changes, create a new branch off `dev` as a `feature-branch` to perform the work
2. Submit a PR to merge your `feature-branch` into `dev`, and get someone from `fendersperth/fenders-website` to approve it (add them to the review and they'll get a notification)
3. Once someone has approved the request, merge it into `dev` :+1:
4. When you've merged it, someone from `fendersperth/fenders-website` will submit a PR to merge from `dev` into `master`
5. Someone else from `fendersperth/fenders-website` or one of the organisers will then approve the request to merge into `master` and deploy the site, pending whether status checks pass :tada:
