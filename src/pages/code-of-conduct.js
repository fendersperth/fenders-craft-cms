            <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
            <p>
                Fenders is a local community group for front end developers. Our
                goal is to create a supportive and collaborative web community
                where we can discuss and share our favourite front end topics!
                At Fenders we don't care what tech you use, how old you are or
                what your gender or religion is. Fenders is for everyone and we
                welcome and support anyone wanting to be part of our community.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Fenders we aim to provide a welcoming and harassment-free
                environment for everyone regardless of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Race</li>
                <li>Gender identity or expression</li>
                <li>Sexual orientation</li>
                <li>Disability</li>
                <li>Physical appearance</li>
                <li>
                    The tech, languages or frameworks you choose to use (There
                    are lots of choices and there are many reasons to use one
                    thing over another, your choice is not the only right
                    choice)
                </li>
                <li>Age</li>
                <li>Religion</li>
                <li>
                    Experience (It does not matter if you have been developing
                    for 1 day or 3 decades, all are welcome to share their
                    experience and learn from each other)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Job role (Whether you are a project manager who loves css or
                    a lead developer looking to chat, we don’t care about your
                    job role, just that you are interested in the front end!)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you choose to participate in Fenders events, as an attendee,
                organiser or volunteer, or you are a member of the online slack
                group, we expect that you follow our community Code of Conduct.
                If you violate the code of conduct you may be banned from future
                events and removed from the Slack group, at the discretion of
                the Fenders organisers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fenders aims to be a safe environment where people can discuss
                front end development and other web related topics. We will not
                tolerate harassment and we expect cooperation from everyone
                involved to help ensure a safe environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are unclear on what constitutes harassment the following
                behaviours will not be tolerated:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Negative behaviour around a person's role, experience or
                    tech choices
                </li>
                <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
                <li>
                    Ongoing disruption of talks or discussions - speakers and
                    organisers spend a lot of time and effort putting together
                    an event that you can learn and be inspired by, please
                    respect while they are presenting.
                </li>
                <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
                <li>Violent behaviour</li>
                <li>Verbal or written abuse</li>
                <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
                <li>Use of sexual language and imagery</li>
                <li>
                    Harassing photography or recording. Not everyone wants to be
                    recorded or photographed. Please respect that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ongoing, unwelcome advances - Fenders is a professional
                    event, please keep things professional.
                </li>
                <li>

            <h2>The Slack Group</h2>
            <p>
                The Fenders slack group is open to all members of the Perth web
                community, and we encourage discussion of topics outside of the
                traditional “front end space”. Please remember that Fenders is a
                professional group for web developers and designers, as a result
                if any of the Fenders organisers directly request you stop
                discussing a topic such as something that promotes hate, abuse
                or any form of harassment you will be expected to follow their
                request. As moderators Fenders organisers reserve the right to
                moderate the group to ensure a safe and welcoming environment
                for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to ignore the requests of the Fenders organisers
                or moderators you may be banned from the slack group and future
                events.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not allow unsolicited DMs in the slack group. Please
                refrain from contacting people directly unless they have
                indicated that you are fine to do so.
            </p>
            <h2>Reporting harassment</h2>
            <p>
                If someone makes you feel unsafe or unwelcome, if you notice
                someone else being harassed or have any concerns please let the
                Fenders organisers know as soon as possible. We understand that
                sometimes you might still be concerned, afraid or feel
                uncomfortable reporting incidents directly so you can also make
                an anonymous report using the google form (
                <a href="https://bit.ly/2smU48D)">https://bit.ly/2smU48D)</a>.
                We will investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to
                prevent the incident occurring again.
            </p>
